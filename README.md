# Pokémon Data Explorer

Looking to build a Pokémon team? This web app provides a convenient, customizable visualization that displays specific  Pokémon depending on the precise user requirements (e.g. HP, attack, type, generation, etc.). With over 800 individual Pokémon, and more on the way, this provides a convenient way to explore the data, and find the right Pokémon to build your team!

Data is taken from the following [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_base_stats_(Generation_VII-present)) page and consists of all Pokémon through the 7th generation (including Alolan forms and Mega Evolutions), along with their main stats.

The app is developed in Python and uses Bokeh for the visualization, and is deployed on Heroku.
